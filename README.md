🗂️ Project Description:
In this analysis, we aim to:

Understand country-wise COVID-19 infection trends.

Compute the maximum daily infection rate for each country.

Join COVID-19 data with the World Happiness Report 2020.

Explore correlations between infection rates and factors like:

GDP per capita

Social support

Healthy life expectancy

Freedom to make life choices


🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy – data cleaning and processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis


📁 Dataset Sources:
COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Dataset (Johns Hopkins University)

World Happiness Report 2020


🔍 Key Steps:
Load and clean COVID-19 data.

Aggregate case counts by country.

Calculate maximum daily infection rates.

Merge with World Happiness data.

Visualize relationships using scatter plots and regression lines.


📊 Visual Insights:
Countries with higher GDP per capita and better social support systems tend to have varied infection rate trends.

Log-transformed infection rates show clearer relationships in scatter plots.


🚀 How to Run:
Clone the repo.

Open the Jupyter Notebook.

Ensure the dataset paths are correctly set.

Run all cells to reproduce the results and visualizations.
